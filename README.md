This is the Coffee Machine Simulator with Java project I made myself.

In this project, I managed to successfully implement:
- Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!
- Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
- Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
- Write for the coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
- Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
- Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
